<h1>STATS LOESS Extension Command</h1>

<p>This command fits a loess regression model.  It fits a low order polynomial to
local subsets of the data with the weight of the points diminishing as the distance
from the center point increases.</p>

<p>The command can be used in two ways.  The first fits a model, creates a prediction
dataset, and optionally saves the fitted model.  The second uses a previously 
saved model to produce a new prediction dataset.  For the second case, the 
keywords for specifying the model and the entire OPTIONS subcommand are
omitted, and the MODELFILE subcommand is used to reference a previously 
saved model.</p>

<p><strong>DEPENDENT</strong> and <strong>INDEPENDENT</strong> name the variables in the model.  There must
be one to four independent variables.  Variables must all be scale-level numeric.</p>

<p><strong>INTERACTIONS</strong> indicates what interaction terms are included in the model.
A value of 1 means main effects only; 2 means all two-way interactions and so on.
The default value is 1.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>MISSING</strong> indicates whether cases with missing values are ignored or whether
they cause the procedure to stop.  Predictions will have SYSMIS values
where inputs are missing.</p>

<p><strong>ALPHA</strong> indicates the amount of smoothing used for the loess fit, e.g., alpha=.5
causes a span of 50% of the data to be used.  Alpha can exceed 1, which 
uses all the cases at each point but slows the decay of the weights.</p>

<p><strong>DEGREE</strong> is the degree of the polynomials that are fitted.  It can be 0, 1, or 2.
A value of 0 means local constant fitting, but the R documentation says to use
this setting &ldquo;with caution&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>NORMALIZE</strong> = YES causes the predictors to be normalized to a common scale
if there is more than one.</p>

<p><strong>FAMILY</strong> determines whether fitting is by least squares (Gaussian) or by
&ldquo;a re-descending M estimator with the Tukey biweight function&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>SURFACE</strong> indicates whether to compute the surface exactly or via interpolation.</p>

<p><strong>STATISTICS</strong> indicates whether to compute approximate statistics or exact ones.
Exact computation is time consuming.</p>

<h2>MODELFILE</h2>

<p>The MODELFILE subcommand allows saving models and using them later.
<strong>SAVEMODEL</strong> takes a file specification for a model.  It is conventional to 
use the extension .Rdata for this.</p>

<p><strong>LOADMODEL</strong> specifies a file containing a previously saved model.  When
used, other model specifications should not be given, and X values must
be given on the PREDICTION subcommand.  If X values are not given.
the output will still display the properties of the loaded model.</p>

<h2>PREDICTION</h2>

<p>The PREDICTION subcommand determines what predicted values are
created.  <strong>DATASET</strong> specifies the name of the dataset.  The name must not
already be in use.</p>

<p>If there are no <strong>X</strong> specifications, the predicted values for the estimation data
and, optionally, their standard errors are saved in the dataset along with 
the dependent and independent variables.  </p>

<p>Alternatively, the X specifications can indicate a different set of points 
where predictions should be calculated.  X specifications must be
used when referring to a saved model in order to produce predictions.
The active dataset is ignored in that case.</p>

<p>These rules.apply to the X specifications.</p>

<ul>
<li>There must be as many X specifications as there are independent
variables in the model with X1 corresponding to the first independent variable
and so on.</li>
<li>Each X specification can be either a list of values (LIST) or a sequence
(SEQ).  The sequence specification is a triple of starting value, ending value,
and increment.  For example, X1SEQ=10 30 10 is equivalent to the values
10, 20, 30.  If the third number is omitted, it is assumed to be 1.
Various other shortcuts are allowed.</li>
<li>If the X specifications are not all the same length, the shorter ones are
recycled to generate the additional values needed.</li>
<li>The prediction dataset includes the X values used, the predictions, and,
optionally, the standard errors.</li>
</ul>
